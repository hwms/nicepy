Nice python tools for those who want to stay sane.

Warnings:
---

These tools are for my view how python should be in some places.

They are neither perfect nor finished developing (nothing is ever imo).

You have to look at the source/test source (for now) to understand usage.

If you don't get the intention, then this isn't made for you.

If you think you have constuctive complains, but don't get the intention, i can't help you.

If you have constuctive complains, please tell me.

If you are ignorant about the lines above, consider an appointment with your local shrink.

Mess with the best, die crying like the rest, but silently or in someone elses ears, please.

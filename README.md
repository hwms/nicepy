Nice python tools for less code.
--------------------------------

Warnings:
---------
* These tools are for my view how python should be in some places.
* They are neither perfect nor finished developing (nothing is ever imo).
* You have to look at the source/test source (for now) to understand usage.
* If you do not get the intention, then this propably isn't made for you.

**I'm not responsible for your broken code!**
